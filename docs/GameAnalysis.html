        <h1>Therapy with Dr. Albert Krueger</h1>
        <p>Therapy with Dr. Krueger is an interactive story game. While the dialog is predetermined,
            we do have the option to make selections during the testing modes. You get to play as
            Taylor, a 19-year-old college student who has been selected to be Dr. Krueger’s latest
            patient, in what he calls ‘Dream Therapy’. Dr. Kuegar who has a degree in Marine
            Biology, seems to be ill equipped to be a therapist. None the less he will be treating
            Taylor at a family run mental facility.Taylor is subject to several weird tests, some of
            which include human body parts. Taylor is being tested on basic math and her listening
            skills. Will Taylor survive the strange testing? </p>
        <section class="gameAnalysis">
            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, it is character locked and we can only control Taylor. The only real
                control we have over Taylor is choosing test answers. For example, there are inkblot
                tests and we get to decide what we see in the inkblot. As the basic dialog is
                predetermined so we just click to continue. Even later in the game when we get a
                chance to ask the doctor questions, it is still preselected dialog. So, the game
                kind of plays as a graphic novel. </p>

            <p>Dr. Albert Krueger. The anatagonist. Interviewing Taylor. "Albert is a sadistic
                murderer, as shown through his demeanor throughout the game. He is shown to be an
                incredibly off-putting and suspicious man. Despite living in G2 his whole life,
                Krueger attended post-secondary education in the G4 District, studying Marine
                Biology at RMU"</p>
            <img src="pics/TayBio.png" alt="taylor" width="400" height="400" />
            <p>"Taylor Lee is a rather vulgar and informal, sometimes monotonous, person, as seen
                throughout the story; they speak very informally in comparison to Krueger,
                occasionally cursing. They are shown to be a very curious person."</p>

                    height="500" />
                <figcaption> This is our very first look at the Doctor. Taylor has just become
                    conscious. It is unclear how she ended up with Doctor Kueger. She is just as
                    confused as we are. After brief introductions, the doctor tells Taylor they will
                    be doing a series of test. </figcaption>
            </figure>

                <figcaption>The first of the testing. Answering basic math questions. Getting them
                    right the Doctor just tells you, you did a great job. However, when answering
                    wrong the Doctor doesn't get mad. He will sometimes say "oh so close" or "not
                    quite" Nothing seems to change when you answer multiple in a row wrong. You do
                    get to reanswer if you answer wrong the first time. During the test, one of the
                    cards becomes covered in blood. The doctor quickly replaces it with a new card.
                    When Taylor asks what happened, he ignores her and continues with more math
                    questions. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="pics/inktest.JPG" alt="lasttest" />
                <figcaption> The inkblot test is by far the hardest of the testing. All of the
                    images are super abstract. They don't seem to look like any of the answer
                    choices. The answer choices are the same on all of the images. You are allowed
                    to flip the ink images over, but the doctor asks you why and you are asked to
                    turn them over. Halfway through the testing, while hovering over the answer
                    choices they start to change. The now flashing answer choices say words in pink
                    lettering such as "murder" and "blood". This is clearly freaking Taylor out and
                    she asks what's going on. Again the doctor just ignores her. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure><img src="pics/yesorno.JPG" alt="yesorno" />
                <figcaption>This was the final test. Seemed like some kind of trust test. As the
                    doctor asks Taylor to close her eyes. We the player can control if Taylor opens
                    her eyes or keeps them closed. This is the section where Taylor finally gets to
                    ask the doctor questions. We find out that this is a family business. And the
                    doctor has a degree in marine biology. We also discover that Taylor and the
                    doctor are both from a place called G2. They both attended the same college
                    there. We don't get any further explanation of what or where G2 is in relation
                    to where they are now. If we open Taylor's eyes, the doctor asks if we are okay,
                    and then we close our eyes again. Opening Taylor's eyes multiple times still has
                    the same reaction from the doctor. While our eyes are closed we hear screams in
                    the background. </figcaption>

                <figcaption>The doctor tells Taylor the next test is a simple ball and cup test.
                    Which Taylor is okay, saying she has played before. Going into the test she
                    seems fine. Then the doctor reveals that the ball they are actually using is an
                    eyeball. Which the doctor justifies because the patient has agreed to let them
                    use it. (yes, the eyeball blinks) The test starts off easy, he may only move the
                    cup once or twice. Gets faster. No, punishment for wrong answers. </figcaption>
            </figure>

                    start.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>The world inside the game is called G2. We learn that both Taylor and
                    Dr. Krueger are from G2 and went to similar colleges.</figcaption>

                <img src="pics/DeadTaylor.jpeg" alt="taylorbody" />
                <figcaption> The punishment for not listening to Dr. Krueger. Taylor is torn apart
                    by some type of androids. And prompts us to play again, but this time listening
                    to the Doctor more. Taylor also doesnt' technically die as she comments on her
                    torn apart state. There are apparently several endings. I just got the bad one.
                    So, while getting the test answers wrong doesn't negatively affect Taylor
                    instantly, it affects the overall game. </figcaption>

                <figcaption>At the very end of the game whether your ending is good or bad you get
                    to rate the experience. However, it doesn't really matter what you pick because
                    it is automatically changed to a postive ranking. </figcaption>
