        <h1>Eisenhower and Brown vs The Board of Education</h1>
        <p> For this assignment, I really wanted to do something with courtroom transcripts. As
            there are hundreds of thousands readily available online to the public. I wanted to use
            a case that was highly publicized. I also wanted the case to have relevance to me. I
            landed on Brown versus the Board of Education. I decided to compare Eisenhower’s second
            inaugural speech to the Brown vs Education case. The supreme court ruled for segregation
            in schools to be stripped away. Then I became curious, about how presidents or one
            president reacts to these things. During the Brown vs Board, Eisenhower was president.
            After checking, his first inaugural address which was in 1953, I realized that he might
            not have seen the point in mentioning the segregation in our school systems, as the law
            hadn’t changed. The law was changed when he was already in his first term of presidency.
            In 1957 after the law was changed 1954, he might have felt the need to endorse
            desegregation. Beyond just mentioning current happenings, I wanted to see if he appeared
            to be in favor of the law. If the language, he used was in support of the new laws. Was
            he arguing against or for the progress? In these text analyses, we will see the
            connections if any between Eisenhower’s second inaugural address and Brown vs The Board
            of education court case. I used voyant tools and antConc to narrow down several keys
            words. To narrow down my search to find connections. </p>

                    education and educational. Only the results were that of education. Just one
                    where he says the progress is welcomed, in education and other industries.
