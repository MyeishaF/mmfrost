       <h1>Eisenhower and Brown vs The Board of Education</h1>
            <p>
                 For this assignment, I
                really wanted to do something with courtroom transcripts. As there are hundreds of
                thousands readily available online to the public. I wanted to use a case that was
                highly publicized. I also wanted the case to have relevance to me. I landed on Brown
                versus the Board of Education. I decided to compare Eisenhower’s second inaugural
                speech to the Brown vs Education case. The supreme court ruled for segregation in
                schools to be stripped away. Then I became curious, about how presidents or one
                president reacts to these things. During the Brown vs Board, Eisenhower was
                president. After checking, his first inaugural address which was in 1953, I realized
                that he might not have seen the point in mentioning the segregation in our school
                systems, as the law hadn’t changed. The law was changed when he was already in his
                first term of presidency. In 1957 after the law was changed 1954, he might have felt
                the need to endorse desegregation. Beyond just mentioning current happenings, I
                wanted to see if he appeared to be in favor of the law. If the language, he used was
                in support of the new laws. Was he arguing against or for the progress? In these
                text analyses, we will see the connections if any between Eisenhower’s second
                inaugural address and Brown vs The Board of education court case. </p>

            <b> Cactus Fun Facts:</b> Cacti life circle lasts from 15 to 300 years, depending on
            the species. You can safely drink water from the cactus. However, it has a higher
            density than regular, tap water. Bees, butterflies, moths, bats, and hummingbirds
            are the main pollinators of the cacti. Instead of leaves, cacti have spines. They
            can be soft or rigid, curved or straight, scattered or somewhat arranged. Spines can
            grow up to 6 inches (15 cm) long. </p>
