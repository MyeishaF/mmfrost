        <h1>Eisenhower and Brown vs The Board of Education</h1>
        <p> For this assignment, I really wanted to do something with courtroom transcripts. As
            there are hundreds of thousands readily available online to the public. I wanted to use
            a case that was highly publicized. I also wanted the case to have relevance to me. I
            landed on Brown versus the Board of Education. I decided to compare Eisenhower’s second
            inaugural speech to the Brown vs Education case. The supreme court ruled for segregation
            in schools to be stripped away. Then I became curious, about how presidents or one
            president reacts to these things. During the Brown vs Board, Eisenhower was president.
            After checking, his first inaugural address which was in 1953, I realized that he might
            not have seen the point in mentioning the segregation in our school systems, as the law
            hadn’t changed. The law was changed when he was already in his first term of presidency.
            In 1957 after the law was changed 1954, he might have felt the need to endorse
            desegregation. Beyond just mentioning current happenings, I wanted to see if he appeared
            to be in favor of the law. If the language, he used was in support of the new laws. Was
            he arguing against or for the progress? In these text analyses, we will see the
            connections if any between Eisenhower’s second inaugural address and Brown vs The Board
            of education court case. I used voyant tools and antConc to narrow down several keys
            words. To narrow down my search to find connections. </p>

                    shocking not to find mentions of equality. After dividing the frequency of the

                    if he even mentioned this progress. In antconc, I searched for the words
                    education and educational. Only the results were that of education. Just one
                    where he says the progress is welcomed, in education and other industries.

                    was still thriving. I wanted to see how Eisenhower mentioned Brown v Board, to
                    try and deny the racism that was still occuring.The general idea of Eisenhower's
                    thoughts on the divide, coincide with the views of Brown v Brown in wanting
                    everyone to be equal. (Eisenhower)</figcaption>

                    searched the n-gram of progress. Did he make mentions of spefic progress, by
                    name? For example the Brown v Board court case. After checking antConc for the
                    word progression occurring in brown v board I was shocked to the words
                    progression and progress had not been mentioned. (Eisenhower)</figcaption>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2> There were so many possible connections I hypothesized. For example, the
        words equality and opportunity. I thought these two would appear in both text. However, they
        only appeared in Eisenhower's speech. Both times, in the text above, I felt like he was
        hinting at Brown v Board. Just not addressing it by name. Referring to our progress, by
        mentioning opportunity and equality. </body>
