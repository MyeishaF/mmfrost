            <p class="wider"> Dahlias are native to Mexico and South America and hold their
                display in reserve for mid-to-late summer and early fall. The genus offers
                an incredible diversity of color and form and we offer dozens of varieties every year.
                Dahlias are perennial but not cold hardy â€“ tubers can overwinter in the ground in
                Zone 8 or warmer; in colder climates tubers can be dug after frost and easily stored
                indoors over winter.. </p>

                <b> Cactus Fun Facts:</b>
                
                Cacti life circle lasts from 15 to 300 years, depending on the species.
                You can safely drink water from the cactus. However, it has a higher density than regular, tap water.
                Bees, butterflies, moths, bats, and hummingbirds are the main pollinators of the cacti.
                Instead of leaves, cacti have spines. They can be soft or rigid, curved or straight, scattered or somewhat arranged. Spines can grow up to 6 inches (15 cm) long.
